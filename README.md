# mAILPal-GPT3.5
A simple chrome extension that uses GPT-3.5 to speed up your email replies

Setup
1. Open answers.js and insert your API Keys (you can generate your InboxSDK API key for free here: https://www.inboxsdk.com/register, and your OpenAI Api Key here: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome Browser and upload the folder
3. Choose an email sequence.. and play :)

Remember that the tool only responds to emails that have been expanded. If you only want to respond to the last response received, do not expand the previous ones and the tool will only consider those.
